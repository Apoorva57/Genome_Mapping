Decoding Covid-19 with Genome Analysis (Machine Learning)
You are one of the researchers responding to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy centerâ€™s call to conduct advanced research on Covid-19. You are working with CDC,  which has led a coordinated effort to set up a machine readable dataset. A dataset that represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for data and text mining to date, with over 29,000 articles, more than 13,000 of which have full text.

Using the CORD-NER dataset and Knowledge Graph, determine and map out the details of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to assist understanding of the emergence, evolution and diagnosis of this deadly virus.
